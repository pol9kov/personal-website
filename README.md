Personal website / landing page built with Next.js 15, showcasing technical skills through code quality and architectural decisions.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This isn't just a landing page—it's a demonstration of:

- Production-ready code architecture
- Performance optimization (Lighthouse 95+)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Modern React patterns (Server Components)
- Professional Git workflow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Rationale

### Next.js 15

**Why:** Latest App Router, Server Components for performance, built-in optimizations

**Alternatives considered:**

- Astro (rejected - less interactive, smaller ecosystem)
- Remix (rejected - smaller community, less tooling)

### TypeScript (strict mode)

**Why:** Type safety prevents runtime errors, better IDE support

### Tailwind CSS

**Why:** Rapid development, consistent design system, small bundle

**Alternatives considered:**

- CSS Modules (rejected - more boilerplate)
- Styled Components (rejected - runtime cost)

### Framer Motion

**Why:** Declarative animations, performance-optimized, great DX

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Target metrics:

- **Lighthouse Score:** ≥95 (mobile + desktop)
- **First Contentful Paint:** <1.5s
- **Time to Interactive:** <2.5s
- **Bundle Size:** <100KB (first load JS)

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Why Server Components by default?

Most portfolio content is static. Server Components reduce JS bundle and improve initial load time.

### Why ISR for dynamic content?

Content changes rarely but needs freshness. ISR provides best balance between performance and updates.
